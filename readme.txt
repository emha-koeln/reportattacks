Report login brute force attacks and improve login security.

== Description ==

Protect against brute force login attempts and create a blacklist of IP addresses.
 
Report not whitelisted IP address attacks to the respective abuse departments of the infected PCs/servers, through free services of blocklist, to ensure that the responsible provider can inform their customer about the infection and disable the attacker. 

No fail2ban or another software required.

We hope our plugin makes the Internet better, safer and helps to clean infected PCs.
